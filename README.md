# clinic_management_API
This is my practise zone in learning django rest framework

Here I implement django rest framework authentication using pyjwt and most of the authentication code is built from scratch.

Authentication took lots of my time to understand but what I take away from this project are:
- Building custome user model
- Its better I use premade packeges for authentication than building my authentication work flows from scratch.
